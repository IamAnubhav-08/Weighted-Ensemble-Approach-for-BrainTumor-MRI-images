# Weighted-Ensemble-Approach-for-BrainTumor-MRI-images

## An ensemble approach using 3 CNN models to classify the brain tumor MRI images

In this project, we try out different transfer learning models such as Resnet50, VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, and MobilenetV2.We find that 3 models reach above 97% test accuracy - VGG19, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2. We deploy a **Grid Search** method to find the optimal weights that give us the best test accuracy.

The final test accuracy of the ensemble model is ***98.98%***
